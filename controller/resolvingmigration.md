challenges with migration 

drifting iisues with table that is not in sync with migration 


**Step 1: Create a New Migration Manually**

**Since **npx prisma migrate dev --create-only** prompts for a reset, manually create a migration folder and file.**

**Create the Migration Folder**: Choose a timestamp later than the last migration (**20250410132230_add_issued_by_to_trashbag_issuance**). For example:


```bash
mkdir prisma/migrations/20250410235959_drop_todo_table
touch prisma/migrations/20250410235959_drop_todo_table/migration.sql
```



**Edit the** **migration.sql** **File**: Open the file:


```bash
nano prisma/migrations/20250410235959_drop_todo_table/migration.sql
```


```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "public"."todo";
```


* * **IF EXISTS** ensures the migration doesn’t fail if the table is already gone.
  * **"public"."todo"** matches PostgreSQL’s schema and table naming.
* **Save and Exit**:
  * **In **nano**, press **Ctrl+O**, then **Enter** to save, and **Ctrl+X** to exit.**
* 

**Step 2: Apply the Migration Without Resetting**

**Apply the migration using **prisma migrate deploy**, which doesn’t prompt for a reset:**


```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```


```*
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "taqa", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"
